# python-slot-machine-game
I created a slot machine game using Python!

Learning Python through classes in school, I wanted to extend a project we were working on and test Python's capabilities. In the video, I go through the different scenarios possible and how to win the game. This was a super fun project for me to grow my skills and overall understanding of Python.
